#MagicVilla_API
I made a REST API with ASP.NET Core 7 using Entity-Framework for accessing SQL Server Database.  
There are CRUD operations for manipulating with the Model of Villa.  
The API is working perfectly ( it is tested with Swagger and Postman).  
I'm using the Interface-Repository Pattern for the operations with Entity-Framework.
